(CVE-2014-3569)\n\n  - The BIGNUM squaring (BN_sqr) implementation does not     properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM value. This     allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic     protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-3570)\n\n  - A NULL pointer dereference flaw exists with     dtls1_get_record() when handling DTLS messages. A remote     attacker, using a specially crafted DTLS message, can     cause a denial of service. (CVE-2014-3571)\n\n  - A flaw exists with ECDH handshakes when using an ECDSA     certificate without a ServerKeyExchange message. This     allows a remote attacker to trigger a loss of forward     secrecy from the ciphersuite. (CVE-2014-3572)\n\n  - A flaw exists when accepting non-DER variations of     certificate signature algorithms and signature encodings     due to a lack of enforcement of matches between signed     and unsigned portions. A remote attacker, by including     crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion,     can bypass fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist     protection mechanisms. (CVE-2014-8275)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability, known as FREAK     (Factoring attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys), exists due to the     support of weak EXPORT_RSA cipher suites with keys less     than or equal to 512 bits. A man-in-the-middle attacker     may be able to downgrade the SSL/TLS connection to use     EXPORT_RSA cipher suites which can be factored in a     short amount of time, allowing the attacker to intercept     and decrypt the traffic. (CVE-2015-0204)\n\n  - A flaw exists when accepting DH certificates for client     authentication without the CertificateVerify message.\n    This allows a remote attacker to authenticate to the     service without a private key. (CVE-2015-0205)\n\n  - A memory leak occurs in dtls1_buffer_record()     when handling a saturation of DTLS records containing     the same number sequence but for the next epoch. This     allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.\n    (CVE-2015-0206)", "solution": "Upgrade to OpenSSL 1.0.1k or later.", "service_name": "http?", "cvss3_base_score": "0.0", "cvss3_vector": "", "cvss_base_score": "5.0", "cvss_vector": "CVSS2#AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P", "cvss_temporal_score": "4.3", "cvss_temporal_vector": "CVSS2#E:ND/RL:OF/RC:C", "exploit_available": "true", "metasploit": "", "cve": "CVE-2015-0206", "cvss_pred < 4": "0.0", "cvss_pred = 4": "1.6355177236e-21", "cvss_pred = 5": "1.0", "cvss_pred = 6": "5.35011690526e-26", "cvss_pred = 7": "5.61294910404e-27", "cvss_pred > 7": "3.00300947452e-34", "cvss_base_pred_offset": [3, 3, 0], "cvss3_pred < 5": "", "cvss3_pred = 5": "", "cvss3_pred = 6": "", "cvss3_pred = 7": "", "cvss3_pred = 8": "", "cvss3_pred > 8": "", "cvss3_base_pred_offset": [0, 0, 0]}, {"plugin_name": "OpenSSL 1.0.1 < 1.0.1m Multiple Vulnerabilities", "plugin_id": "82032", "plugin_type": "remote", "port": "80", "protocol": "tcp", "description": "According to its banner, the remote web server uses a version of OpenSSL 1.0.1 prior to 1.0.1m.

The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nMitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.\n\nAs long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.\n\nThe TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.\n\nThis is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation.

Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer.
