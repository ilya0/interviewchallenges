The vulnerability is due to the way SSL 3.0 handles padding bytes when decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode.\nMitM attackers can decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256 tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.\n\nAs long as a client and service both support SSLv3, a connection can be 'rolled back' to SSLv3, even if TLSv1 or newer is supported by the client and service.\n\nThe TLS Fallback SCSV mechanism prevents 'version rollback' attacks without impacting legacy clients; however, it can only protect connections when the client and service support the mechanism. Sites that cannot disable SSLv3 immediately should enable this mechanism.\n\nThis is a vulnerability in the SSLv3 specification, not in any particular SSL implementation.

This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer.

Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer.

Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer.

Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer.
